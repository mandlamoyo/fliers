Machine Learning Java Project

This is a machine learning demo in the style of top down shooters, such
as 'Raiden'. The idea of the simulation is to illustrate the process of
neural network evolution by showing computer-controlled ships learning to
navigate around (or possibly destroy) various obstacles, as well as pursue
various powerups.
